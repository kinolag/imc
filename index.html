    This is one of those projects that you don't consider finished, until you "decide" they are.
    <br><br>
    When I started it, I was planning to work on certain music tracks, but then the project took its own direction as it often happens, and test after test I found myself with a number of video files. I chose certain versions among the ones available, but the selection could as well change.
    <br><br>
    They are audiovisual sessions produced and recorded "in real time".
    <br><br>
    The music tracks I used are by the artists listed under each video.
    <br><br>
    While I hold all the rights on the images in these works (except the N.U. documentary re"viewed" in <a href="llcd_16.html" class="A_g6_m" title="llcd 16">LLCD_16</a>) and the system used to produce them, the music remains the property of its authors or other right holders.
    <br><br>
    In other words, I have no rights on the music I used, and if any of the right holders is against the use of a track in one of the videos presented here, I kindly ask to contact me via email to let me know. Thank you.
